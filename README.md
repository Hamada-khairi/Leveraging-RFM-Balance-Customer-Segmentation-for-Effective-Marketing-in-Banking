## 🌟 Overview
This project implements various clustering algorithms to segment bank customers based on their purchasing behavior. By leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) combined with customer balance data, this system enables targeted marketing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and drive profitability.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and filters irrelevant data for a clean dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates essential features such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary, and Customer Age.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into customer distribution, behavior patterns, and financial health.
- **Clustering Models**: Implements K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to identify distinct customer segments.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses Silhouette Coefficient and Calinski-Harabasz Index for model performance assessment.
- **Personalized Marketing Strategies**: Offers targeted marketing recommendations based on customer segments.

## 📂 Project Structure
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepares the dataset, handles missing values, and filters data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Develops key features like RFM and customer age.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes data insights such as gender distribution, account balance, and customer location.
4. **Clustering Implementation**: Applies K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics for optimal customer segmentation.
